# X Programming Language

```Rust
fn main() -> i64 {
    let val = "hello, world\n";
    outStr(val);
    return 0;
}
```

X is a simple low-level programming language ideal for *type-safety*, *fast-runtimes* and an 
*opinionated compiler*. The compiler itself runs on the JVM, and generates the intermediate representation
for LLVM, enabling the binary output to achieve similar performance to C++ and Rust. This also has the 
added benefit of making the compiler cross-platform.

To get started with X, see the [getting started](/docs/getting-started/) information here.

For a look at the formal CFG of the language, see the [grammar page](/docs/grammar)
